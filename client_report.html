    <h1>Client</h1>
    <p>I knew right away that I wanted to create something related to cooking. While playing Wordle, I came up with the idea for a "Recipe of the Day" website. I finalized the logo after consulting a friend who specializes in graphic design.</p>
    <p>I communicated with the lead developer primarily through email and later via text. The communication went smoothly, and I believe he fully understood my vision for the project.</p>
    <p>In fact, the final product exceeded my expectations. Given the complexity of the website, I didn’t anticipate it turning out as well as it did. The lead developer and his team did a fantastic job bringing my ideas to life.</p>
    <p>If I were to do a similar project in the future, I would provide more initial content. Since this site was meant to be fairly small, I only gave them ten recipes. Next time, I would aim to include more content to make the site more robust.</p>

    <h1>Lead Developer</h1>
    <p>I managed the development team through email and GitHub. Whenever tasks needed to be assigned or issues arose, I used email to communicate our next steps.</p>
    <p>I stayed in contact with the client primarily via email. There were a few minor issues, such as delays in receiving the logo and a couple of misunderstandings regarding the website features, but overall the communication was effective.</p>
    <p>Publishing and sharing the site was straightforward. GitHub Pages is a very user-friendly platform, and I encountered no significant issues during deployment.</p>

    <h1>Junior Developer</h1>
    <p>Before I begin, I want to clarify that I only worked on one of the sites, so my responses will reflect that specific experience.</p>
    <p>Our team lead set up a Discord server for communication, which worked well initially. However, when I had specific questions, I didn’t always receive timely responses from the lead developer. Despite that, communication was generally adequate.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, the site plan provided enough detail for me to understand my responsibilities and complete my tasks confidently.</p>
    <p>I believe I met the client’s expectations. I followed the site plan closely to ensure the design matched the original vision.</p>
    <p>I did encounter some issues when trying to publish changes to someone else’s GitHub repository. I asked for help in Discord but didn’t receive a response. Eventually, I received assistance from the instructor, and the publishing process worked fine afterward.</p>

    <h1>General Experience and Reflections</h1>
    <p>The most challenging aspect of this project was team communication as a junior developer. Unanswered questions sometimes led to delays and misunderstandings.</p>
    <p>My favorite part of the project was definitely designing the site plan. I enjoyed creating the logo and choosing the colors and overall aesthetic for the website.</p>
    <p>If I could redo this project as a client, I would include more content from the start. I think the final version felt a bit bare-bones, though that’s not a reflection on the lead developer’s work.</p>
    <p>Absolutely. This project gave me valuable insight into what it’s like to work in a team environment. I’ve learned several important lessons about collaboration, communication, and meeting expectations in a real-world setting.</p>
